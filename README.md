# Fault Detection in Tail Rope Using Deep Learning

This project implements a deep learning-based fault detection system for tail ropes, aiming to identify wear, damage, and other faults to improve safety and maintenance in industrial applications.

## Overview

Tail ropes are critical components in many mechanical and industrial systems. Early detection of faults such as fraying, surface scratches, and misalignments can prevent catastrophic failures. Traditional methods of fault detection are often manual, time-consuming, and inaccurate.

This project uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), specifically the Inception V3 architecture, to automatically analyze images of tail ropes and classify faults with high accuracy.

## Features

- Automated detection of various faults in tail ropes using image data.
- Utilizes transfer learning with the Inception V3 model for effective feature extraction.
- Achieves high accuracy (~96%) in fault classification.
- Provides real-time fault diagnosis potential in industrial settings.
